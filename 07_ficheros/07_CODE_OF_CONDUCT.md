# Contributor Covenant Code of Behavior

## Scope and enforcement

This Code of Behavior applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at opensource@github.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### 2. Warning

A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Behavior, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Behavior, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
